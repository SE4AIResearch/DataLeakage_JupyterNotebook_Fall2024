    "# We turn our attention to **classification**[^classification]. Classification tries to predict, which of a small set of classes, a sample in a population belongs to. Mathematically, the aim is to find $y$, a **label** based on knowing a feature vector $\\x$. For instance, consider predicting gender from seeing a person's face, something we do fairly well as humans. To have a machine do this well, we would typically feed the machine a bunch of images of people which have been labelled \"male\" or \"female\" (the training set), and have it learn the gender of the person in the image. Then, given a new photo, the algorithm learned returns us the gender of the person in the photo.\n",

The code takes the traning set, splits it into `n_folds` parts, sets up `n_folds` folds, and carries out a cross-validation by splitting the training set into a training and validation section for each foldfor us. It prints the best value of the parameters, and retuens the best classifier to us.\n",

The classification is done by setting those samples for which `targetname` has value `target1val` to the value 1, and all others to 0. We split the dataframe into 80% training and 20% testing by default, standardizing the dataset if desired. (Standardizing a data set involves scaling the data so that it has 0 mean and is described in units of its standard deviation. We then train the model on the training set using cross-validation.

    "# We said that another way to think about a noisy $y$ is to imagine that our data $\\dat$ was generated from  a joint probability distribution $P(x,y)$. Thus we need to model $y$ at a given $x$, written as $P(y|x)$, and since $P(x)$ is also a probability distribution, we have:\n",

If for example the probability of classifying a test sample as a '0' was 0.1, and it turns out that the test sample was a '0', it does not mean that this model was necessarily wrong. After all, in roughly a 10th of the draws, this new sample would be classified as a '0'! But, of-course its more unlikely than its likely, and having good probabilities means that we'll be likely right most of the time, which is what we want to achieve in classification. And furthermore, we can quantify this accuracy.\n",

If so, you'll offer me an incentive not to defect. In this scenario, you might want to know which customers are most likely to defect, or even more precisely, which are most likely to respond to incentives. Based on these probabilities, you could then spend a finite marketing budget wisely.\n",
